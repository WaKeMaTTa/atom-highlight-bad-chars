# highlight-nbsp package

Atom package to highlight no-break spaces in text files.

No-break spaces happen easily when accidentally pressing `alt-space` in atom
or other editors. It is hard to spot as it looks like normal space character,
but that one character will mess up source codes and scripts alike.

With this package you'll easily notice annoying invisible character and save
yourself of the burden to debug code for hours.
